# Justice Uganda website
I designed this website with an insight that alot of Ugandans have no access to legal knowledge and services so this website is in place to educate the masses in Uganda about their rights given to them by the 1996 Uganda Consititution.!
Any form of conribution in form of ideas is highly welcome!!
